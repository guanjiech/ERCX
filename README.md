# ERCX
This standard grants Non-Fungible Tokens with usage rights. Through this standard, you can achieve :

- Separation of the usage right and ownership of Non-Fungible Token
- Non-secured lease Non-Fungible Token
- You can continue to use it after you mortgage the Non-Fungible Token
- Metaverse sharing economy

It is precisely because of the separation of ownership and use right that the utilization rate of assets can be greater. You must distinguish between the rights of the user and the owner.

The EIP consists of two interfaces, found as {IERCX},{IERCXEnumerable}. The first one and the {https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol } are required in the contract to be ERCX compliant. The enumerable extension is provided separately in {ERCXEnumerable}.
